This Folder is responsible for handling all the services and API calls. Each service has a spec.ts file for
testing purpose and a ts file in which our main functionality for service will be written. Services refers to
a reusable variable/data that can be shared and used outside component in which it is defined. These are
basically typescript classes with @injectable decorator, which means this class is a service and can be
injected in the component that needs that service.
